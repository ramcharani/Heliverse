# Employee Attrition Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the IBM HR Analytics dataset titled "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, along with the following libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the main Python script named "assignment_predicting_employee_attrition.py".
   
## Additional Information
* The dataset used in this project contains information about IBM employees, including demographics, job roles, and performance metrics.
* The code preprocesses the data, performs feature engineering, and trains several machine learning models for predicting employee attrition.
* Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC are calculated to assess the performance of the models.
